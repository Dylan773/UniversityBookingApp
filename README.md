# UniversityBookingApp
Second-year project for the Object-Orented Development module, created using Java and JavaFX for the GUI.
This applicaion allows second-year students to select their final year modules, dependant on their chosen course.

This booking application includes appropiate validation, reducing the liklihood of a user intentionally, or accidentally exploiting the application's functionality. Furthermore, added functinality allowes a user's profile to be saved exteranlly, recording the student details and chosen modules; whilst enabling student profiles to loaded into the application for viewing.

JavaFX was used for the layout and position of UI elements, no GUI builders were used. Additionally, an external CSS stylesheet was integrated for efficient UI styling, colouring and spacing of eleemts.
